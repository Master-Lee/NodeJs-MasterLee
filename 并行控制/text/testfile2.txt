If I were to fall in love,It would have to be with youYour eyes, your smile,The way you laugh,The things you say and do
Take me to the places,My heart never knew
So, if I were to fall in love,It would have to be with you. 
Ed Walter 
Forgive me for needing you in my life; 
Forgive me for enjoying the beauty of your body and soul; 
Forgive me for wanting to be with you when I grow old
